    - name: RunWhen Local Installation Guide
      url: https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/runwhen-local/user-guide/features/getting-started
      description: |
        RunWhen Local is a container-based tool that runs on your local machine or inside your Kubernetes cluster.
        It discovers your cloud and Kubernetes resources, matches them to relevant CodeBundles, and generates
        troubleshooting commands you can run immediately.

        Installation methods:
        1. **Kubernetes (Helm)**: Deploy as a pod in your cluster using the Helm chart.
           - Add the RunWhen contrib Helm repo: `helm repo add runwhen-contrib https://runwhen-contrib.github.io/helm-charts`
           - Install: `helm install runwhen-local runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local -n runwhen-local --create-namespace`
           - Port-forward to access the UI: `kubectl port-forward -n runwhen-local svc/runwhen-local 8081:8081`
        2. **Docker**: Run locally with Docker.
           - `docker run -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest`
        3. **Docker Compose**: Use docker-compose for more advanced configurations with custom kubeconfigs and cloud credentials.

        After installation, access the web UI at http://localhost:8081 to see discovered resources and matching troubleshooting commands.

      description: |
        Common troubleshooting steps for RunWhen Local:
        - If the UI shows no resources, check that your kubeconfig is correctly mounted and has access
        - If discovery is slow, ensure network access to your clusters
        - Check logs with: kubectl logs -n runwhen-local deployment/runwhen-local
        - For Docker: docker logs <container-id>
        - Restart discovery by restarting the container or pod

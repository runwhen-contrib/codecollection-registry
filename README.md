# CodeCollection Registry

A modern, scalable registry for RunWhen CodeCollections with AI-powered enhancement capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The new microservices architecture is located in the `cc-registry-v2/` directory:

```bash
cd cc-registry-v2/
task setup    # Initial setup
task start    # Start all services
task --list   # See all available commands
```

## Legacy Static Site

The original static site generator is still available in the root directory.

## Requesting or Tracking CodeBundles
CodeBundles can be requested through the [Issues templats](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-registry/issues/new/choose)

CodeBundle development status can be tracked in the following [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/runwhen-contrib/projects/1) 


## Repository Purpose
Static site (generated by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)) of all community Troubleshooting and Day 2 CodeCollections from the RunWhen Community. Scripts can be shared and imported into:
- [RunWhen Platform](https://www.runwhen.com)
- [RunWhen Local Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/runwhen-local)

## Building Locally

### Local System Install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generate_registry.py
mkdocs serve -f cc-registry/mkdocs.yml 
```

### Local Docker Build
If building locally, the `./rebuild.sh` will build and run a docker container that can be used to test changes without installing dependencies. 


## Deployment
```
mkdocs gh-deploy -f cc-registry/mkdocs.yml 
```

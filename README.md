# codecollection-registry
CodeCollection Registry Site - Managed by terraform


## Purpose
Static site (generated by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)) of all community Troubleshooting and Day 2 CodeCollections from the RunWhen Community. Scripts can be shared and imported into:
- [RunWhen Platform](https://www.runwhen.com)
- [RunWhen Local Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/runwhen-local)

## Building Locally

### Local System Install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generate_registry.py
mkdocs serve -f cc-registry/mkdocs.yml 
```

### Local Docker Build
If building locally, the `./rebuild.sh` will build and run a docker container that can be used to test changes without installing dependencies. 


## Deployment
```
mkdocs gh-deploy -f cc-registry/mkdocs.yml 
```
